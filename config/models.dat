The StandardModel_SLHA2 model contains the SM parameters that are defined in the SMINPUTS, VCKMIN and UPMNSIN blocks of the second SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA2):

ScalarSingletDM_Z3: |

   The singlet DM model with a Z3 symmetry. Note that mS should either be interpreted as the tree level mass or directly as the pole mass for S. This is analogous to the treatment of the SM Higgs mass in the model StandardModel_Higgs.

   lambda_hS  - coupling for vertex connecting the SM Higgs to the new scalar
   mS         - the mass of the scalar DM candidate
   mu3        - coefficient of S^3 Lagrangian term

QEWSB specifies the scale at which the electroweak symmetry-breaking (EWSB) consistency condition that the Higgs potential possess a tree-level minimum is imposed. This model is intended for use in situations where the Higgs potential is run to different scales, e.g. for calculating pole masses or investigating vacuum stability.

Halo_Einasto: |

   a local dark matter density rho0, and a local Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.
   Here, rhos and rho0 are set independently of each other.

Halo_Einasto_rho0: |
   Same as Halo_Einasto, but instead of giving rhos explicitly as a parameter, it is derived
   from the local dark matter density rho0 and the other parameters of the density profile.

Halo_Einasto_rhos: |
   Same as Halo_Einasto, but instead of giving rho0 explicitly as a parameter, it is derived
   from the scale density rhos and the other parameters of the density profile.

Halo_gNFW: |
   Dark matter halo model corresponding to a generalized NFW density profile with scale density rhos,
   a local dark matter density rho0, and a local Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.
   Here, rhos and rho0 are set independently of each other.

Halo_gNFW_rho0: |

   from the local dark matter density rho0 and the other parameters of the density profile.

   M12          - universal gaugino mass
   SignMu       - the sign of the mu parameter
   TanBeta      - the ratio of the up-type to down-type Higgs vevs

StandardModel_Higgs: |

   Simple Higgs model containing the SM tree-level Higgs mass mH as the only parameter, which is interpreted as the pole mass by most calculations. This generally removes the need to calculate it via renormalisation group running in any higher-energy theory. When observables are to be calculated that genuinely need to use running parameters, the model point is up-translated to a parameter point in the StandardModel_Higgs_running (the parent model), where mH^2 at scale mZ is set equal to the square of the tree-level mass, and QEWSB is set to the top mass. This is useful for more detailed calculations involving module functions that explicitly require the running mass parameter of StandardModel_Higgs_running, and/or functions that need accurate pole masses calculated by including the Higgs sector in renormalisation calculations.

WC: |

   An implementation of the standard effective field theory for the study of rare meson decays, based on the decomposition of the effective Hamiltonian into a linear combination of interactions specified with Wilson coefficients. This model incorporates enhancements and suppressions to the real and imaginary parts of the Wilson coefficients of the effective operators O7 , O9 , O10 , Q1 and Q2 (see the GAMBIT core paper for details and definitions).

ScalarSingletDM_Z2_running: |

   The scalar singlet DM model with lambda_S (the scalar self-coupling), lambda_hS (the scalar-SM Higgs interaction strength) and mS (the mass of the new scalar) defined at the scale mZ as free parameters, allowing full calculation of pole masses, renormalisation group running and vacuum stability.
