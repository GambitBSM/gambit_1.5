# =======  1) Install GAMBIT & Backends =========
#
#   => To install GAMBIT do
#     (check README.md for more details on prerequisites & dependencies)
#
#         Note:
#         -----
#           *) for this specific yaml file you only need CosmoBit and NeutrinoBit
#                 => there is no need to build all Bits of GAMBIT, you can ditch the others
#                    with the cmake flag -Ditch="Collider;Dark;Decay;Spec;Flav;Precision"
#           *) you will need the python package cython (now added to cmake prerequisite)
#
#
#      cmake -Ditch="Collider;Decay;Spec;Flav;Precision;Neutrino;Dark" -DWITH_MPI=ON ..
#      make -jn scanners (where n specifies the desired number of cores for the build, e.g. 4)
#      cmake ..
#      make -jn gambit
#      make -jn alterbbn montepythonlike classy
#
#   => To look at available capabilities of different Bits and explanations of capabilites, models & their parameters.. do
#      ./gambit CosmoBit  (DarkBit,...)
#      ./gambit <capability_name>
#      ./gambit <model_name>
#
#    => To clean/nuke a backend just do
#
#     make clean-<backendname>
#     make nuke-<backendname>
#
#    => To check if a backend is correctly installed & look at available backed functions
#     ./gambit backends
#     ./gambit <backend_name>
#

#======== 2) Input parameter declarations =======
#  In this section, the models to be scanned over are specified. You can
#  set all model parameters here or import another yaml file containing them.

#   comparison of different sampling algorithms in https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07959

#======== 6) Observables of interest ========
#
# Specify all likelihoods (driving the scan) and observables (just printed, don't influence scan)
# that should be calculated
#
#
#

ObsLikes:

  # ---- 6.a) BBN -----

  # Likelihood from BBN; use deuterium (D) and Helium-4 (He4)
  - purpose:      LogLike
    capability:   BBN_LogLike
    sub_capabilities: [D, He4]

  # print isotope abundances + errors
  # As D and He4 are used for BBN_LogLike, they are automatically included.
  # Here we also include Helium-3 and Lithium-7
  - purpose:      Observable
    capability:   BBN_abundances
    sub_capabilities:
      - He3
      - Li7


  # ---- 6.b) MontePython Likelihoods -----

  # The total lnL from MontePython
  # Since the single MontePython likelihoods are not implemented in GAMBIT as capabilities
  # (and are more flexible -- you import them at runtime and don't need to know their names
  # at compile time) you can just tell GAMBIT here which to include
  - purpose:      LogLike
    capability:   MP_Combined_LogLike
    module:       CosmoBit
    type:         double
    sub_capabilities:
      # Include BAO likelihoods:
      # Galactic data:
      bao_boss_dr12: default
      # (use custom data file for bao_smallz_2014 likelihood)
      bao_smallz_2014: CosmoBit/data/BAO/bao_galactic_settings.data
      # Lyman alpha data:
      eBOSS_DR14_Lya_combined: default

  # A breakdown of each likelihood component in the above total lnL,
  # plus any others that you might like to compute but not include in the
  # likelihood.
  - purpose:      Observable
    capability:   MP_LogLikes
    type:         map_str_dbl

  # Add Omega0_m  to output data file
  - purpose:     Observable
    capability:  Omega0_m
    function:    get_Omega0_m_classy


#======== 7) Rule entries ========
Rules:

  # ----------- 7.a) BBN Likelihoods, AlterBBN interface -----------
  #                (CosmoBit Module paper, Appendix C.1)

  # error calculation precision settings for AltterBBN
  # (use failsafe 1 and 0 to speed up Helium abundance calculation for testing)
  # (For more precise calculations, use 3 or 7)
  # Here, we choose err: 0, as the error calculation is dictated by the rule below
  - capability: AlterBBN_Input
    options:
      failsafe: 3
      err: 0

  # Fix relative error and covariance of helium-4 and deuterium abundances
  - capability: BBN_abundances
    options:
      isotope_basis: [Yp, D]
      correlation_matrix: [[+1.000e00, +1.524e-2],
                           [+1.524e-2, +1.000e00]]
      relative_errors: [1.348e-3, 1.596e-2]


  # ----------- 7.b) MontePython Likelihoods ------------
  #         (CosmoBit Module paper, Appendix C.4)

  # Choose which function to use for initialising the input parameters to be sent to CLASS.
  # If including MontePython likelihoods in your scan, the first option must be used.
  # If you have not installed MontePython, the second option must be used.
  # GAMBIT will stop and tell you to fix this if you get it wrong though, so don't stress.
  # (i) set CLASS input with MP compatibility
  - capability: classy_MPLike_input
    function: set_classy_input_with_MPLike
  # (ii) set CLASS input without MP compatibility
  #- capability: classy_final_input
  #  function: set_classy_input


  # ----------- 7.c) "Global" (CossmoBit-wide) settings ------------

  # By default, CosmoBit does not allow negative values for dNur_BBN and dNur_CMB as this can
  # lead to unphysical inputs in cases where dN_ur < 0 and abs(dN_ur) > N_ur contribution from 3 SM neutrinos today.
  # As this scan assumes only one massive neutrino, the resultant inputs for CLASS remain valid
  # and we can safely circumvent the limitation
  - module: CosmoBit
    options:
      allow_negative_delta_N_ur: true

#======== 8) Logging setup ========
Logger:
  # log tags => check default.log and CosmoBit.log to see more details than
  # printed to screen
  redirection:
    [Debug]   : "debug.log"
    [Default] : "default.log"
    [CosmoBit]: "CosmoBit.log"
    [Scanner] : "Scanner.log"

#======== 9) Generic Name/Value Section ========
KeyValues:

  # if set to true, the log files will contain more information, e.g.
  # the complete input dictionary passed to CLASS for each parameter point
  debug: true

  # where to safe the output
  default_output_path: "runs/CosmoBit_quickStart"

  likelihood:
    model_invalid_for_lnlike_below: -1e30
