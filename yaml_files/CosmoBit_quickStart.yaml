# =======  1) Install GAMBIT & Backends =========
#
#   => To install GAMBIT do 
#     (check README.md for more details on prerequisites & dependencies)
#  
#         Note: 
#         -----
#           *) for this specific yaml file you only need CosmoBit, DarkBit and NeutrinoBit 
#                 => there is no need to build all Bits of GAMBIT, you can ditch the others 
#                    with the cmake flag -Ditch="Collider;Decay;Spec;Flav;Precision"
#           *) some of the backends needed for the scan are only available in python2 so far 
#                 => if you have python 3 you have to set cmake flags to your python2 library and
#                 interpreters s.t. GAMBIT is configures with python2
#                 If the -DFORCE_PYTHON2 flag does not do the job you have to provide the following paths, something like
#                 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.7
#           *) you will need the python package cython (now added to cmake prerequisite)
#   
#
#      cmake -Ditch="Collider;Decay;Spec;Flav;Precision;Neutrino;Dark" -DFORCE_PYTHON2=ON -D WITH_MPI=ON ..
#      make -jn scanners (where n specifies the desired number of cores for the build, e.g. 4)
#      cmake ..
#      make -jn gambit
#      make -jn alterbbn montepythonlike classy
#
#   => To look at available capabilities of different Bits and explanations of capabilites, models & their parameters.. do
#      ./gambit CosmoBit  (DarkBit,...)
#      ./gambit <capability_name>
#      ./gambit <model_name>
#
#    => To clean/nuke a backend just do
#     
#     make clean-<backendname>
#     make nuke-<backendname> 
#
#    => To check if a backend is correctly installed & look at available backed functions 
#     ./gambit backends   
#     ./gambit <backend_name>
#
# ======================================


#======== 2) Input parameter declarations =======
#  In this section the models to be scanned over are specified. You can 
#  set all model parameters here or import another yaml file containing them. 
#  
#  => for more details check out chapter 6.2 of the GAMBIT manual (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07908) 
#

Parameters:

 # Neutrino masses, choose between normal hierachy (NH) and inverted hierarch (IH)
 #    To fix the sum of the neutrino masses to 0.06 with only one massive neutrino

 #    into the scan)

#======== 3) Prior setup ========
# you can also have an extra section specifying priors. Or just do it as above
# for details check chapter 6.3 of the GAMBIT manual (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07908) 
Priors:

#======== 4) Output setup ========
# different output formats, for details check chapter 6.6 of the GAMBIT manual (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07908) 
Printer:
  printer: ascii
  options:
    output_file: "gambit_output.data"
    buffer_length: 100

#======== 5) Scanner setup ========
# different scanner settings, for details check chapter 6.7 of the GAMBIT manual (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07908) 
#   comparison of different sampling algorithms in https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07959

Scanner:
  # use random just for testing. 
  use_scanner: random

  scanners:
    multinest:
      plugin: multinest
      like:  LogLike
      nlive: 1000
      tol: 0.01

#======== 6) Observables of interest ========
#
# Specify all likelihoods (driving the scan) and observables (just printed, don't influence scan)
# that should be calculated
#
#
#

ObsLikes:
  

  # ---- 6.a) BBN -----
  # Likelihood from BBN (need to specify which data to use in rules section below in 7.a))
  - purpose:      LogLike
    capability:   BBN_LogLike
    module:       CosmoBit
    type:         double
  
  # print helium abundance + error 
  - purpose:      Observable
    capability:   Helium_abundance
    module:       CosmoBit
    type:         std::vector<double>


  # ---- 6.b) MontePython Likelihoods -----
  # The total lnL from MontePython
  # Since the single MontePython likelihoods are not implemented in GAMBIT as capabilites
  # (and are more flexible -- you import them at runtime and don't need to know their name
  # at compile time) you just tell GAMBIT to include the likelihoods coming from MP here
  # => specify which ones to use below in the Rules section 7.b)
  - purpose:      LogLike
    capability:   MP_Combined_LogLike
    module:       CosmoBit
    type:         double

  # A breakdown of each likelihood component in the above total lnL
  # (just to print the single contributions of the total sum)
  # => this would e.g. print LogLike(BAO) and LogLike(Pantheon)
  - purpose:      Observable
    capability:   MP_LogLikes
    type:         map_str_dbl


#======== 7) Rule entries ========
Rules:

  # ----------- 7.a) BBN Likelihoods, AlterBBN interface -----------
  #                (CosmoBit Module paper, Appendix C.1)

  # Set path to file containing measured values of light element abundances to use for 
  # Likelihood calculation (assumes root directory is gambit/CosmoBit/data/BBN)
  - capability: BBN_LogLike
    options:
      DataFile: PDG_2017.dat # Use both, the Yp and D/H measurement as given in PDG 2017
      #DataFile: PDG_2017_updated.dat # Use the Yp measurement from PDG 2017 and the updated D/H measurement of 1801.08023
  
  # error calculation precision settings for AltterBBN
  # (use 1 and 0 to speed up Helium abundance calculation for testing)
  # (For more precise calculations, use 3 or 7)
  - capability: AlterBBN_Input
    options:
      failsafe: 3
      err: 1

  
  # ----------- 7.b) MontePython Likelihoods ------------
  #         (CosmoBit Module paper, Appendix C.4)

  # Set the names of the MP likelihoods that should be used in the scan. 
  # Note: You can get a list with all available likelihoods if you misspell one of the likelihoods below,
  #     GAMBIT will throw an error that this likelihood is not know and print a list with all implemented ones 
  - capability: MP_experiment_names
    function: set_MP_experiment_names
    options:
      # add likelihoods to be used for scan here & set path to the '<likelihood_name>.data' file containing
      # the settings you want the likelihood to run with (e.g. path to data, which z-bins to use... ). 
      # Note that the path has to be relative to your GAMBIT directory. 
      # If you set it so "default" the default MontePython file 'Backends/installed/montepythonlike/<version>/
      #     /montepython/likelihoods/<likelihood_name>/<likelihood_name>.data'   will be used
      #
      Likelihoods: 
        bao_smallz_2014: default #../montepython_public/montepython/likelihoods/bao_smallz_2014/bao_smallz_2014.data
        Pantheon: default
        Planck_SZ: default
      # should eventually be possible to choose any MP like, atm only bao, Pantheon, Planck_SZ safe to use (& kids after 
      # downloading data and when commenting out line 'parser_mp.existing_file(fname)', will include that into 
      # build step soon) 
      # still need to test all Likes

  # Set if CLASS input parameters are passed with (i) or without (ii) setting arguments from MontePython (MP) Likelihoods
  # This is important to set correctly for each run since: 
  #   => if MontePython Likelihoods are used but CLASS is not initialised with the MP arguments 
  #      it could lead to a SegFault or unreasonable/random LogLike values as MP might try to access
  #      quantities that have not been computed
  #   => if no MP likelihoods are used but CLASS is initialised with MPLike arguments you might be 
  #      scanning over nuisance parameter models that are not needed without realising it. 
  # (i) set CLASS input with MP arguments
  - capability: classy_final_input
    function: set_classy_input_with_MPLike
  #   ||
  #   \/
  # (ii) set CLASS input without MP arguments
  # If not MontePython Likelihoods are used, use this rule
  #- capability: classy_final_input
  #  function: set_classy_input
