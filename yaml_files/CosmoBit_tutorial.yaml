# =======  Install GAMBIT =========
#
#   => To install GAMBIT do
#     (check README.md for more details on prerequisites & dependencies)
#
#         Note:
#         -----
#           *) for this specific yaml file you only need CosmoBit, DarkBit, NeutrinoBit and PrecisionBit
#                 => there is no need to build all Bits of GAMBIT, you can ditch the others
#                    with the cmake flag -Ditch="Collider;Decay;Spec;Flav"
#           *) if you want to force GAMBIT to configure with python2 and
#                 if you have python3 installed, you have to set cmake flags to your python2 library and
#                 interpreters s.t. GAMBIT chooses python2
#                 If the -DFORCE_PYTHON2 flag does not do the job you have to provide the following paths, something like
#                 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.7
#           *) you will need the python package cython (included in the cmake prerequisite)
#
#
#      cmake -Ditch="Collider;Decay;Spec;Flav" ..
#      make -jn scanners (where n specifies the desired number of cores for the build, e.g. 4)
#      cmake ..
#      make -jn gambit
#
#   => To look at available capabilities of different Bits and explanations of capabilites, models & their parameters.. do
#      ./gambit CosmoBit  (DarkBit,...)
#      ./gambit <capability_name>
#      ./gambit <model_name>
#
#
# ======================================

# ======= Install needed backends =========
#
#   => To use this yaml file you need to make
#
#     make -jn alterbbn darkages montepythonlike plc plc_data classy_exo_2.7.2
#
#       *) alterbbn: to calculate light element abundance (https://alterbbn.hepforge.org/)
#            => the resulting helium fraction is an input for CLASS
#       *) darkages: DarkAges module to compute the energy deposition of any exotic kind. (https://github.com/pstoecker/DarkAges)
#       *) montepythonlike: to have cosmological likelihoods from MontePython available to use (almost) out of the box
#            (https://www.groundai.com/project/montepython-3-boosted-mcmc-sampler-and-other-features/2#bib.bib81)
#       *) plc: Planck likelihoods
#       *) plc_data: download of data needed for Planck likelihood calculations
#       *) classy(_exo_2.7.2): Boltzmann solver to get CMB spectra, mPk,.. (http://class-code.net/)
#
#           Note:
#           -----
#              x Alternatively you can also make 'classy' (standard version of CLASS) instead of 'classy_exo_2.7.0'
#                 If you do that, however, you won't be able to use any capabilities depending on CLASS output when you
#                 scan a model with exotic energy injection into the CMB.
#              x If you have more than one classy version installed, GAMBIT will throw an error during the
#                 dependency resolution. This is the case as the different CLASS versions can all satisfy
#                 the same capabilities. To fix this, either set a rule for each CLASS-related capability which
#                 version GAMBIT should use (see comments in section C.7)) or (easier) uninstall all classy versions you don't want to use (see below).
#
#
#    => To clean/nuke a backend just do
#
#     make clean-<backendname>
#     make nuke-<backendname>
#
#    => To check if a backend is correctly installed & look at available backed functions
#     ./gambit backends
#     ./gambit <backend_name>
#
#
# ======================================

  # For a full list of all implemented inflation models and their parameters refer to Appendix B.2
  # of the CosmoBit module paper
  #Inflation_InstReh_1linear:
  #  lambda:
  #    range: [1.9e-10,2.2e-10]
  #    prior_type: flat


  # ====== B.3) Neutrino Masses =======

  # Neutrino masses, choose between normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH)
  StandardModel_mNudiff: !import include/StandardModel_mNudiff_NH_scan.yaml
  #StandardModel_mNudiff: !import include/StandardModel_mNudiff_IH_scan.yaml

  # To fix the sum of the neutrino masses to 0.06 eV with only one massive neutrino
  # (as in Planck 'baseline' analysis don't include the model 'StandardModel_mNudiff'
  # into the scan)
  # uncomment the line below (and do not use 'StandardModel_mNudiff')
  #StandardModel_SLHA2: !import include/StandardModel_SLHA2_Planckbaseline.yaml



  # ====== B.4) Non-standard radiation content (optional) =======

  # If you would like to study extensions of LCDM including non-standard radiation
  # content, you can add the most general model 'etaBBN_rBBN_rCMB_dNurBBN_dNurCMB'
  # and its parameters, or any child model thereof. See Appendix B.4 of the CosmoBit
  # module paper for a detailed description.

  # example 1: extension of standard LCDM allowing for an increased value of dNeff
  # during the epoch of recombination and today. If you want dNeff to be allowed to
  # take negative values (knowing this can lead to an unphysical negative contribution to
  # Omega_r0, the energy density in radiation today) you can do this by
  # including an additional rule. It's explained below, search for #negative-dNeff
  dNurCMB:
   dNur_CMB:
     prior_type: flat
     range: [0.0,1.0]

  # example 2: Most general model for non-standard radiation content and its parameters.
  #etaBBN_rBBN_rCMB_dNurBBN_dNurCMB:

  #    prior_type: flat
  #    range: [5e-10,7e-10]
  #  r_BBN:    # = T_nu/T_nu^LCDM, parametrises non-standard neutrino temperature during BBN
  #    prior_type: flat
  #    range: [0.2,1.2]
  #  r_CMB:    # = T_nu/T_nu^LCDM, parametrises non-standard neutrino temperature during recombination
  #    prior_type: flat
  #    range: [0.2,1.2]
  #  dNur_BBN: # additional ur species during BBN
  #   prior_type: flat
  #   range: [0.0,1.0]
  #  dNur_CMB: # additional ur species during recombination (assumed to be still ur today)
  #   prior_type: flat
  #   range: [0.0,1.0]


  # ====== B.5) Energy injection (optional) =======

  # If you would like to study scenarios of energy injection between z~30 and z~2700 of annihilating or decaying DM,
  # you need to include a model, which is in relation to AnnihilatingDM_general or DecayingDM_general and provides the
  # injected spectrum of photons and e+/e-. See Appendix B.5 of the CosmoBit module paper.
  # In the initial CosmoBit version, We provide simple "mixture" models for both scenarios and child models thereof.
  # These mixture models assume mono-energetic dark matter decays/annihilations into photons, and e+/e- with branching fractions BR_el and BR_ph
  # The complementary branching fraction (1-BR_el-BR_ph) accounts for possible inefficient final states such as neutrinos
  # In the examples included, no inefficient contribution is assumed such that BR_el + BR_ph = 1 holds
  # And BR_ph has to be derived from BR_el -> "same_as" prior
  # To study one of the natively supported models, you just need to include the model in the scan.
  #AnnihilatingDM_mixture:
  #  mass:                    # (mass in GeV)
  #    range: [1e-2, 1e4]
  #    prior_type: log
  #  BR_el:
  #    range: [0.0, 1.0]
  #  BR_ph:
  #    same_as: AnnihilatingDM_mixture::BR_el
  #    shift: 1.0
  #    scale: -1.0

  #    range: [1e-2, 1e4]
  #    prior_type: log

  #    same_as: DecayingDM_mixture::BR_el
  #    shift: 1.0
  #    scale: -1.0
  #  lifetime:               # (lifetime in s)

  #  fraction:               # (initial fractional decaying dark matter abundance)
  #    range: [1e-12, 1e-6]
  #    prior_type: log

  # ====== B.6) Cosmological nuisance parameters (depending on included likelihoods) =======

  # If likelihoods that require the use of nuisance parameters are used in the scan, the
  # parameters have to be included as models here.
  #  => if you don't include the Planck likelihoods into the scan you should get a FATAL Error
  #     telling you that no function requires any of the model parameters, comment this line out
  #     to fix it
  # (try to comment this line or the Planck likelihoods then you can see the different error messages)
  cosmo_nuisance_Planck_lite: !import include/Planck_2018/cosmo_nuisance_Planck_lite_flat.yaml

  # Include this if you use the Pantheon SNe likelihood into your scan
  # Note: - for all official MontePython likelihoods that require nuisance parameters, a model
  #   called 'cosmo_nuisance_<likelihood_name>' is implemented. Run ./gambit cosmo_nuisance_<likelihood_name>
  #   to check the names of the parameters in GAMBIT and set the ranges and priors here.
  #   - if you include a nuisance model that is not required by any likelihood, GAMBIT will
  #   exit and tell you the name of the parameter that is not needed. Likewise, if you forget
  #   to include a nuisance parameter model, GAMBIT will tell you which one is (likely) missing.
  cosmo_nuisance_Pantheon:
    M:
      prior_type: flat
      range: [-20,-18]


  # ====== B.7) Neutron lifetime (optional) =======

  # Neutron lifetime.  If this is not included as a model, the lifetime will default to 879.4 s
  # (PDG 2019 recommendation http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/listings/rpp2019-list-n.pdf).
  # Note: If you include any likelihoods related to the neutron lifetime, you have to include
  # PrecisionBit in the build!
  nuclear_params_neutron_lifetime:
    neutron_lifetime:
      range: [875,895]


Priors:
#======== Prior setup ========

  #- purpose:      LogLike

  # ---- 4.2) CMB -----
  # if you type e.g., ./gambit Planck_lowl_loglike you will see that there are different functions that

  # ---- 4.3) Late-time cosmology: MontePython Likelihoods -----
  # The total lnL from MontePython
  # Since the single MontePython likelihoods are not implemented in GAMBIT as capabilities
  # (and are more flexible -- you import them at runtime and don't need to know their name
  # at compile time) you just tell GAMBIT to include the likelihoods coming from MP here
  # => specify which ones to use below as sub-capabilities
  # => this would e.g. contain LogLike(BAO)+LogLike(Pantheon)

      Pantheon: default
      #Planck_SZ: default

  # A breakdown of each likelihood component in the above total lnL
  # (just to print the single contributions of the total sum)
  # => this would e.g. print LogLike(BAO) and LogLike(Pantheon)
  # => In case the user wants to get a specific likelihood (e.g LogLike(hst))
  #    but does not want to use it to drive the scan, it can be added as a sub-capability

  # In order to speed up the error estimation of the BBN abundances, we provide the option to manually set the covariance
  # matrix used for the evaluation of the BBN likelihood by assuming their relative errors and/or their correlations are constant.
  # We performed parameter scans of  non-standard cosmologies (with varying baryon-to-photon ration and dNeff and taking the
  # the uncertainties in the neutron lifetime into account) and chose conservative values for all error estimates and correlations.
  # The advantage of the use of pre-defined correlation matrix is to safe computational resources when performing
  # large parameter scans and to remove the effect of some outliers of the error estimates due to numerical problems in the error estimation.
  # See discussion in section 4.1 of the CosmoBit module paper (around eq. 4.3) for more details on how this was obtained.
  # This option can be used by specifying the names of the isotopes of which the covariance matrix should be modified. (If missing, an error is thrown)

  # This rule is only strictly needed when
  # Option a): more than one MP likelihoods with nuisance parameters are in use
  # Option b): if no MP settings shall be passed to CLASS, i.e. if no MP likelihood
  #     is in use. In practice, you should never have to set this. GAMBIT will take
  #     care of this automatically.
  # => It's best to play safe and never include this rule, unless GAMBIT specifically

  # ---- C.6) plc related settings -----

  # If you use any of the Planck likelihoods and you do not want to download the
  # Planck data through gambit (type 'make plc_data' in the build directory)
  # then you can set the path to the directory where you have downloaded the data

  # ---- C.7) Finally "Global" (CossmoBit-wide) settings ----

  # By default, CosmoBit does not allow negative values for dNur_BBN and dNur_CMB as this can
  # lead to unphysical inputs in cases where dN_ur < 0 and abs(dN_ur) > N_ur contribution from
  # 3 SM neutrinos today. If you want to circumvent this limitation, uncomment the following lines
  # (#negative-dNeff)
  #- module: CosmoBit
  #  options:
  #    allow_negative_delta_N_ur: true
